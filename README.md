# Data Mining course homework
### This repository holds homework that I submitted for my Data Mining course during my Master's program
#### The HTML and QMD files have the same questions and coding responses, however the html files hold the actual output of the related code
#### Each pairing of HTML and QMD files are named as it relates to the modeling techniques of that week.
