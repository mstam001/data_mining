# Data Mining course homework
### This repository holds homework that I submitted for my Data Mining course during my Master's program
#### The HTML and QMD files have the same questions and coding responses, however the html files hold the actual output of the related code. Unfortunately, github has listed the HTML files as to large to view within github, so they will have to be downloaded and viewed by opening with a internet browser (chrome, etc.).
#### Each pairing of HTML and QMD files are named as it relates to the ML model/techniques of that week.
